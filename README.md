# Cybersecurity Internship Task 8: VPN Analysis Report

This report documents the hands-on setup and analysis of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service as required by the internship task.

### Objective
[span_0](start_span)The objective of this task was to understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and enabling secure communication.[span_0](end_span)

## 1. VPN Setup and Verification

The following steps were taken to set up and verify the VPN connection:

1.  *[span_1](start_span)Chose a Reputable VPN Service*: A free VPN service was selected and I signed up for an account.[span_1](end_span)
2.  *[span_2](start_span)Installed the Client*: The VPN client was downloaded and installed on my local machine.[span_2](end_span)
3.  *[span_3](start_span)Established Connection*: I connected to a VPN server to route my internet traffic through it.[span_3](end_span)
4.  *[span_4](start_span)Verified IP Address*: I confirmed that my public IP address had changed by using an online IP checker tool.[span_4](end_span) This confirms that my traffic appears to be coming from the VPN server's location, not my own.
5.  *[span_5](start_span)Tested Browsing*: I browsed a website to confirm that internet traffic was being successfully encrypted and tunneled.[span_5](end_span)

## 3. Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations

[span_6](start_span)This task provided hands-on experience with VPNs and an understanding of privacy tools.[span_6](end_span) Here is a summary of their benefits and limitations:

### Key Benefits
* *[span_7](start_span)Privacy Protection*: A VPN protects privacy by masking your real IP address with that of the VPN server.[span_7](end_span) This prevents websites, advertisers, and your ISP from easily tracking your location and online activity.
* *[span_8](start_span)[span_9](start_span)Data Encryption*: VPNs use encryption to create a secure, private tunnel for your internet traffic.[span_8](end_span)[span_9](end_span) This makes your data unreadable if it's intercepted, which is especially important on public Wi-Fi networks.
* *[span_10](start_span)[span_11](start_span)Secure Communication*: By using tunneling protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard, a VPN ensures that the connection between your device and the server is secure.[span_10](end_span)[span_11](end_span)

### Key Limitations
* *[span_12](start_span)Reduced Network Speed*: Since your traffic is being routed through an additional server and encrypted, a noticeable decrease in network speed can occur.[span_12](end_span)
* *[span_13](start_span)No Guarantee of Complete Anonymity*: A VPN does not guarantee 100% anonymity.[span_13](end_span) The VPN provider could potentially log your activity, and you can still be tracked by other means like browser cookies or device fingerprinting.
* *[span_14](start_span)Difference from a Proxy*: Unlike a simple proxy, a VPN encrypts all traffic from the device, not just from a single application or browser.[span_14](end_span) However, both route traffic through an intermediary server.
